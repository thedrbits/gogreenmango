Thank you for using our mobile app that provides alerts when Disneyland Reservations become available. We take your privacy and the security of your personal information seriously, and we want you to feel confident that your information is safe and protected.

We only collect and use the minimum amount of personal information necessary to provide our service to you, including your phone number to send you alerts when Disneyland reservations become available. We do not sell or share your personal information with any third parties.

We use industry-standard security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, or destruction. We also use encryption and secure connections to protect your data transmission over the internet.

Our app may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not controlled by us. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those websites or services and encourage you to read their privacy policies before providing any personal information.

By using our app, you agree to the terms of this privacy policy. If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy practices, please contact us at support@greenmangosystems.com.

We may update this privacy policy from time to time.

We would like to add that our mobile app that provides alerts when Disneyland Reservations become available is not affiliated or associated with Disney in any way. Our app is an independent service that simply provides notifications when reservations become available.
